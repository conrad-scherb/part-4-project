  abstract        = {The NeuroVision technology is a noninvasive, patient-specific, perceptual learning program based on visual stimulation and facilitation of neural connections at the cortical level, involving a computerized visual training regimen using Gabor patches, to improve contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. The efficacy of NeuroVision in enhancing uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and unaided contrast sensitivity function (CSF) in patients with low myopia or early presbyopia was evaluated. Seventeen patients with low myopia (up to -1.75 D) and 21 patients with early presbyopia (up to +2.50 D add) were recruited in 2 clinical sites. Eleven myopic and 18 presbyopic patients underwent the NeuroVision program (treatment group), and 9 patients performed visual examinations only, serving as a control group. The low myopia treatment group achieved a mean improvement of 2.2 logMAR lines in unaided VA, from 0.42 to 0.20 logMAR. Unaided CSF improved at all spatial frequencies (1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18 cpd). The early presbyopia treatment group achieved a mean improvement of 2.2 logMAR lines in near UCVA, from 0.47 to 0.25 logMAR. Near unaided CSF also improved at all spatial frequencies. The control patients in both arms of the study have not shown any significant change in vision. Additionally, the mean refractive error in all groups remained unchanged after treatment. Results to date suggest that the NeuroVision technology is effective in improving UCVA and unaided CSF in low myopia and early presbyopia.},

  abstract   = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},
